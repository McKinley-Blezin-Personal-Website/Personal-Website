    <h3> New Journey</h3>
<div id="box1">
  <p> Recently I have moved back to the east coast from AZ and my hobbies have drastically changed since relocating. I've gone on my 1st hike at <em>White Tank Moutain Regional Park</em>. I was able to see wonderful views that I couldn't even imagine in my dreams, and feel recharge in all aspects of life.
